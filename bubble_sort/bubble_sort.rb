# Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array.
# It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldnâ€™t it?).

# set is_sorted flag
# iterate through the array continuously until is_sorted is no longer false (the conditional below is not triggered)
# if first element is greater than second
#   - swap elements
#   - set flag to false since it will need to be sorted again
# return sorted array
